# pi_dash - automotive (rally) dash written in Elixir and React that runs on Raspberry Pi

pi_dash is an application that can replace your cars standard gauges with customizable dashboard where you can choose which reading you would like to see. 

The reason this project came to life is that my amateur rally car was lacking a tachometer, coolant temperature etc gauges, which would be quite helpful in extreme rally conditions. 

In the beginning I only wanted to make a simple tachometer, but then decided to go full in and came up with this.

## **Note:** The project is still in development and was tested only on several cars. Since I am not a design expert the GUI would use some enhancements - but for now it's the simplest working solution.
